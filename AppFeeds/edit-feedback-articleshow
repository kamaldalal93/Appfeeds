		"Story": "SRINAGAR (UTTARAKHAND) Shubham Tomar, 22, can still recall the feel of the cold, hard floor of his house in Chakrata in Dehradun district where he had spent endless hours studying for the <a type=\"topic\" href=\"https://m.timesofindia.com/topic/Joint-Entrance-Examination\">Joint Entrance Examination</a> (JEE) Mains in 2015. When he gained admission to the Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal branch of the National Institute of Technology (<a type=\"topic\" href=\"https://m.timesofindia.com/topic/NIT\">NIT</a>), one of the country’s premier engineering technology institutions, he believed his days of struggle were over and his future was secure.\n\nFour years on, Tomar, now in his fourth year of BTech studies, is foremost among the over 900 NIT students sitting on an indefinite strike since October 4 in support of their demand for a permanent campus. The institute, considered second only to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), is running on borrowed space, on the terrace of a government polytechnic college with a tin roof in place of a concrete one.\n\n<img src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=66159180\" imageid=\"66159180\" h=\"1000.0\" w=\"635.0\" /> \nAnd while in any other part of the hills, monsoon is welcomed with local festivals held in hopes of a good harvest, students and faculty here dread the rains, because the tin roof over classrooms starts leaking. Several hostel rooms on the ground floor even need to be evacuated because of seepage and leaks. Many students have been housed in hotels far away from the campus, instead of in hostels.\n\n<slideshow tn=\"photo\" hl=\"It's an NIT, but its campus is virtually non-existent\" imgcnt=\"4\" id=\"66137672\" imageid=\"66137672\" dm=\"t\" cap=\"The sign says 'National Institute of Technology' but it's actually the government polytechnic building\" wu=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/slidesowdev/its-an-nit-but-its-campus-is-virtually-non-existent/photostory/66137672.cms\"></slideshow> \nThe NIT was set up in 2010 and the campus was to be established at a 300-acre plot in Sumari, 15 km from the current location. The plot, however, was declared unfit for development and construction. Makeshift arrangements were made to hold classes on the first floor of a polytechnic. In eight years, the situation has not changed. \nThe recent protest was prompted after two students of the college were hit and injured, one severely, by a car while crossing the road to go the lab 200 metres from the campus, on the busy National Highway 58. On Tuesday, many NITs across the country held candle-lit prayers for the girl student who is battling for her life at AIIMS Rishikesh. \n\nThe protesting students in Srinagar said that several of them had narrowly escaped accidents in the past and the situation worsens during the Char Dham pilgrimage when there is a rush of vehicles on the road. \n\n“It is high time we got a campus of our own. This has put not just our studies but also our lives at peril,” said student Krunal Suryawanshi.\n\n<video type=\"kaltura\" src=\"{\"vr\":[{\"url\":\"http://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/nh/1xnhd1sgzl/hls/master.m3u8\",\"res\":\"auto\"},{\"url\":\"http://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/nh/1xnhd1sgzl/701d9d1480_F30_480p_900.mp4\",\"res\":\"480\"},{\"url\":\"http://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/nh/1xnhd1sgzl/701d9d1480_F40_360p_600.mp4\",\"res\":\"360\"},{\"url\":\"http://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/nh/1xnhd1sgzl/701d9d1480_F51_240p_256.mp4\",\"res\":\"240\"},{\"url\":\"http://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/nh/1xnhd1sgzl/701d9d1480_F60_144p_100.mp4\",\"res\":\"144\"},{\"url\":\"http://slike-v.akamaized.net/1x/nh/1xnhd1sgzl/701d9d1480_F70_96p_48.mp4\",\"res\":\"80\"}]}\" id=\"66159074\" imageid=\"66159074\" caption=\"Eight years on, NIT Uttarakhand yet to get its own campus\" cap=\"Eight years on, NIT Uttarakhand yet to get its own campus\" su=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.comvideos/news/eight-years-on-nit-uttarakhand-yet-to-get-its-own-campus/videoshow/66159074.cms\" du=\"01:07\"></video> \nSeveral students who burnt the midnight oil to qualify as future engineers said that they were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at the campus, whose beautiful location overlooking the lush Garhwal hills belies the squalor inside its buildings. While third and fourth year students of the institute are housed in hotels in the town and travel several kilometres to attend classes every day, the juniors, over 400 of them, are living in cramped conditions in five tiny hostels, with six students forced to live in a 10x8ft room. For every 50 students, there is just one toilet. <ad type=\"mrec\"></ad>\nSome students from the girls’ hostel said that a chicken-pox outbreak had occurred in the campus recently after infected students were made to sleep in the same room as there was no extra space to quarantine them. Students also said that they were staring at a bleak future as companies often shied away from holding placement tests in the campus as it was in a remote location. The students are demanding that the land for the campus be allotted somewhere in the plains.\n\nThe Union HRD ministry had scrapped 50% of BTech seats at the institute this year because it does not have its own land and buildings.\n\nUttarakhand higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat told TOI, “The state government has provided 300 acres of land to the institute in Sumari area of Pauri Garhwal district and another 112 acres in Jaletha, just next to Sumari. The institute’s campus will be built on the land, which is fit for this purpose. If the institution had issues with the plot, they should have mentioned it at the time of allotment of the land, and not after a lot of money has been spent on the boundary wall.”\n\nNIT authorities said that they have the funds for a state-of-the-art campus but they were lying unused as no land has been allotted by the state government. \nR B Patel, director in-charge, NIT Srinagar told TOI, “We were allotted land last year after students had protested, but it turned out to be in an earthquake-prone zone.”\n\n",
